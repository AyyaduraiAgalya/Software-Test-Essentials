# **Software-Test-Essentials**

## **Introduction**
Welcome to the **Software-Test-Essentials** repositoryâ€”a curated, hands-on collection of testing frameworks, tools, and artifacts designed to showcase comprehensive expertise in software testing. This repository demonstrates practical skills across manual testing, automation, performance testing, security testing, and more, tailored to align with industry standards and real-world scenarios.

The repository is structured to help hiring teams quickly assess my technical capabilities, testing mindset, and ability to deliver high-quality software testing solutions.

---

## **Purpose**
The primary goal of this repository is to:
- **Showcase proficiency**: Demonstrate expertise in various tools, frameworks, and testing methodologies.
- **Replicate real-world scenarios**: Develop solutions for challenges typically encountered in software development lifecycles.
- **Facilitate learning and growth**: Continuously evolve the repository with new tools, frameworks, and techniques as I enhance my skills.

---

## **Contents Overview**
This repository includes multiple sections to cover all critical aspects of software testing. Each section contains:
- Artifacts (test cases, plans, reports) or frameworks (automation, performance, etc.).
- Code samples or configurations demonstrating tool usage.
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining the setup, execution, and purpose of each framework.

### **Key Sections**
1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Test cases, defect reports, exploratory testing examples, and requirement analysis artifacts.
   - Tools and examples for defect management and documentation.

2. **Automation Testing**:
   - Core automation frameworks (Selenium, TestNG, Postman, SQL).
   - Advanced tools (Cypress, Playwright, Rest Assured, Karate DSL, Appium).

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Tools: JMeter, Gatling, and k6 for load and stress testing.
   - Integration with real-time monitoring using Grafana and InfluxDB.

4. **Security Testing**:
   - Vulnerability scanning using OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite.
   - Examples addressing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

5. **Cloud-Based Testing**:
   - Automation using AWS SDK and Azure/GCP integration.
   - Distributed testing with Selenium Grid and Docker.

6. **DevOps & CI/CD**:
   - Pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions.
   - Containerized test environments with Docker and Kubernetes.

7. **Accessibility Testing**:
   - Compliance testing using AXE, WAVE, and Lighthouse.

8. **Miscellaneous**:
   - Cross-browser testing with BrowserStack/Sauce Labs.
   - Test management tools (TestRail/Zephyr) integrations.
   - Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Cucumber.
